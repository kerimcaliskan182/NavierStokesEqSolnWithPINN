# NavierStokesEqSolnWithPINN
This Python script solves the Navier-Stokes equations using Physics-Informed Neural Network. This approach enables the modeling of fluid dynamics problems by learning the velocity field and pressure distribution around a cylindrical obstacle in a flow, as is commonly encountered in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
